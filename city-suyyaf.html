		<h4>Student life is hectic enough as is, which is why some may find Shah Alam a welcoming respite.

Known to be a peaceful and reserved neighbourhood, Shah Alam is boasts of plentiful nature-oriented recreational activities. 

If your ideal life involves lakeside jogs after work or weekend hikes, Shah Alam is home to the Bukit Cerakah Forest Reserve, Shah Alam Extreme Park, and multiple golf clubs.  

Properties within Shah Alam can be on the luxurious side if you’d prefer, with many developers eyeing this neighbourhood for its spaciousness and serenity. Some examples of these townships include Ecoworld Sanctuary, Bandar Rimbayu, and Tropicana Aman.

The student population in Shah Alam stems mostly from Universiti Teknologi MARA Shah Alam (UiTM), Management and Science University (MSU), and UOW Malaysia KDU, to name a few. </h4>

	<h2><strong>Subang Jaya</strong></h2>
		<img src="https://cdn-cms.pgimgs.com/static/2020/08/neighbourhoods-selangor-9.jpg" width="400">
		<br>
		<h4>While most suburban townships are known to be sleepy cities, Subang Jaya is far from that.

Many families may call Subang Jaya home, but the area is also known to be a hip and trendy hotspot, with ample amenities catered to the large youth population.

The northern end of Subang bears the “SS” address, with SS15 as the primary commercial hub. Replete with cafes and all sorts of F&B establishments, there’s no shortage of culinary treasures to explore here. 

The southern end sees UEP Subang Jaya (USJ), with both USJ 9 and 10 serving as the main commercial hubs. 

If you’re a student, you’d be glad to know that Subang isn’t just all work and no play. The area has blossomed with many shopping complexes – Empire Subang, Subang Parade, Sunway Pyramid, SS15 Courtyard, One City, Main Place and many more. 

Wherever you live in Subang, there’s bound to be a neighbourhood shopping mall that's a stone’s throw away!</h4>

	<h2><strong>Cyberjaya</strong></h2>
		<img src="https://cdn-cms.pgimgs.com/static/2020/08/neighbourhoods-selangor-4.jpg" width="400">
		<br>
		<h4>Cyberjaya is Malaysia’s very own attempt at a Silicon Valley of our own. This IT-themed city plays a key role in our Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).

This means you can expect only the best possible environment for multimedia companies, exemplified by the numerous MNCs that have set up operations in Cyberjaya.

The town was established relatively recently, and offers a quiet living away from the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur, despite being just 25 km away.

While properties in Cyberjaya are generally more upmarket, the city is also associated with a decent number of universities and cheaper properties to cater to the student population. These universities include University of Cyberjaya, Multimedia University (MMU), and Limkokwing University. 

If people were cities, Cyberjaya would be the neat, reserved introvert who’s often working late into the night! Fret not though, as Dpulze Shopping Centre and Gem In Mall make for the city’s fun streak. 

Cyberjaya has a green lung to her too, in the form of Cyberjaya Lake Gardens.</h4>
